# **Titanic Dataset Analysis**

## Project Summary

This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to explore survival rates based on factors such as gender, passenger class, and age. The analysis seeks to identify patterns and insights that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

## Key Features

### Data Processing

Loaded and cleaned the Titanic dataset for analysis.

Addressed missing values, particularly in age and cabin data.

### Data Analysis

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine survival rates across various categories.

Visualized key metrics such as gender, class, and age groups.

### Insights

Identified significant factors affecting survival.

Highlighted differences in survival rates across passenger groups.

## Dataset Description

### Source

Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

### Key Features

Survival: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1: survived, 0: did not survive).

Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

Name: Passenger name.

Sex: Passenger gender.

Age: Passenger age.

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.

Fare: Ticket fare.

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C, Q, S).

### Data Processing Steps

Handled missing values in the Age and Embarked columns.

Created new features such as age groups for better analysis.

## Analysis Highlights

Survival by Gender

Women had significantly higher survival rates compared to men.

Visualized using bar charts and pie charts.

Survival by Class

1st class passengers had the highest survival rate.

3rd class passengers were the most vulnerable group.

Survival by Age

Children had higher survival rates compared to adults.

Analyzed survival distribution across age groups.

Survival by Port of Embarkation

Survival rates were examined based on embarkation ports (C, Q, S).

## Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


## Results and Insights

Gender: Women had a significant advantage in survival chances.

Class: 1st class passengers were prioritized for lifeboats.

Age: Children had notably higher survival rates.

Future Work

Add advanced statistical tests to validate findings.

Explore the relationship between ticket prices and survival within each class.

Build a predictive model to estimate survival chances.
